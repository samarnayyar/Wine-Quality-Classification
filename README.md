#  Wine Quality Classification Project üç∑

A machine learning project to classify red wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of red wine samples to build classification models that predict whether a wine is "good" (quality ‚â• 7) or "bad" (quality < 7) based on its chemical properties.

**Key Features:**
- Data exploration and visualization
- Synthetic data generation for class balancing
- Comparison of 6 machine learning models
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Feature importance analysis

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains 1,599 red wine samples with 11 physicochemical features and a quality rating.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

## üìâ Models Evaluated

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Logistic Regression
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. Gradient Boosting

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Clone and setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samarnayyar/Wine-Quality-Classification.git
cd wine-quality-classification
```

### 2. Run the analysis
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Wine_Quality_Analysis.ipynb
```

## Results

The best performing model which was Random Forest achieved 96% accuracy.
